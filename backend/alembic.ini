# files is "os", which uses os.pathsep. If this key is omitted entirely, it falls back to the
# legacy behavior of splitting on spaces and/or commas.
# Valid values for version_loc_sep are:
#
# version_loc_sep = space
# version_loc_sep = comma
# version_loc_sep = os  (use os.pathsep)
#
# or you can pass an arbitrary separator, such as:
# version_loc_sep = :

# set to 'true' to search source files recursively
# in each "version_locations" directory
# new in Alembic version 1.10.0
# recursive_version_locations = false

# It will be dynamically set in the env.py file

# set up pre-commit hooks in the repository.
