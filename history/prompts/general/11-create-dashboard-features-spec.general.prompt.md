- UI/UX design specifications with layout structure
- Non-functional requirements for performance and user experience
- Technical constraints and success criteria
- User scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Quality gates and validation requirements

## Outcome
Complete specification document that defines the dashboard features including task management, search/filter/sort capabilities, state management, and persistence requirements.

## Evaluation
The specification successfully captures all requirements from the user input and provides a clear foundation for implementation.
