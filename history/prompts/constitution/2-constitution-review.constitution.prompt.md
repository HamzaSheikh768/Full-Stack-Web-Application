# Prompt History Record: Constitution Review and Compliance Check

## Original Prompt
```
file:///e:/Phase%202/Full-Stack-Web-Application/.specify/memory/constitution.md maximum 1000 line of words
```

## Response Summary
Reviewed the existing constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and confirmed that all template placeholders have already been properly replaced with specific content for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application project. The constitution is complete with:

- Core Principles: Spec-Driven Development, Modularity and Reusability, Security First, User-Centric Design, Efficiency, and Visual Consistency
- Key Standards: Development workflow, project structure, technology stack
- Feature Definitions: Core, Intermediate, and Advanced CRUD operations
- Full UI Definition: Pages, components, styling and animations
- Constraints and Success Criteria
- Governance rules

The document is well-formatted, under 1000 lines, and ready for use as the governing document for the project.

## Outcome
Confirmed constitution file is properly populated and compliant with requirements. No further modifications were needed as all placeholders had already been replaced with project-specific content.

## Evaluation
✅ All template placeholders have been replaced
✅ Document is under 1000 lines as requested
✅ All required sections are present and properly filled
