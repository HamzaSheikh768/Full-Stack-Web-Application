# Implementation Tasks: Backend Todo API

## Feature: Backend Todo API Implementation

**Overview**: Implementation of a secure, RESTful API backend for the Todo application using Python FastAPI, SQLModel for ORM, and Neon Serverless PostgreSQL for storage. The backend will handle multi-user data isolation via JWT authentication from Better Auth, integrating with frontend API calls.

## Phase 3: [US1] User Authentication & Authorization

**Goal**: Enable the backend to verify JWT on all requests and filter data by authenticated user.

**User Story**: As the backend, I verify JWT on all requests and filter data by authenticated user.

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- JWT tokens from Authorization header are properly verified using BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
- User_id from JWT payload is validated against URL parameter
- HTTP 401 is returned for invalid/missing tokens
- Authentication is applied to all /api/{user_id}/* routes
- Users can only access their own data (user isolation enforced)

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [ ] T016 [US1] Test authentication flow with valid and invalid JWT tokens

## Phase 4: [US2] Task CRUD Operations

**Goal**: Enable the backend to handle task creation, retrieval, updates, deletions, and status toggles with validation.

**User Story**: As the backend, I handle task creation, retrieval, updates, deletions, and status toggles with validation.

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- Users can create tasks with title (required, 1-100 chars), description (≤5000 chars), priority, tags, due_date, recurrence
- Users can retrieve all their tasks with optional filtering and sorting
- Users can update task properties with partial updates allowed

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- System supports priority levels: high, medium, low
- System supports tagging with multiple tags per task
- System supports due dates stored in UTC and converted to user's local time for display
- System supports recurrence patterns: none, daily, weekly

- [ ] T029 [US3] Test task property creation and updates with validation

## Phase 6: [US4] Search, Filter & Sort

**Goal**: Enable the backend to allow searching, filtering, and sorting of tasks.

**User Story**: As the backend, I support priorities, tags, due dates, search/filter/sort queries.

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- System allows searching by keyword across title and description
- System allows filtering by status (all, pending, completed)
- System allows filtering by priority levels
- System allows date range filtering (from/to specific dates)
- System allows sorting by due_date, priority, or title in ascending/descending order

**Implementation Tasks**:

## Phase 7: [US5] Recurring Tasks

**Goal**: Enable the backend to manage recurring tasks (auto-rescheduling logic).

**User Story**: As the backend, I manage recurring tasks (auto-rescheduling logic) and store reminders for frontend triggering.

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- System creates new task instances when recurring tasks are marked complete
- System calculates next due date based on recurrence pattern (daily: +1 day, weekly: +7 days)
- System creates recurring tasks with completed=False status

## Phase 8: [US6] Data Isolation & Security

**Goal**: Ensure the backend enforces proper data isolation between users.

**User Story**: As the backend, I verify JWT on all requests and filter data by authenticated user.

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- System filters all queries by user_id to prevent cross-user access
- System validates that requested resources belong to authenticated user
- System returns HTTP 404 for resources belonging to other users
- All authenticated endpoints properly validate JWT tokens
- Rate limiting (100 requests per IP per hour) prevents abuse

- [ ] T047 Implement comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] T048 Add input validation to all endpoints to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] T049 Create database indexes for efficient querying (user_id, completed, due_date, priority)
- [ ] T050 Optimize database queries for performance
- [ ] T051 Add logging for audit trails and debugging
- [ ] T052 Conduct final acceptance testing against all user stories
- [ ] T053 Document API endpoints with examples

## Dependencies

- US1 (Authentication & Authorization) must be completed before US2, US3, US4, US5, and US6
- US2 (Task CRUD Operations) is foundational for US3, US4, US5, and US6
- US3 (Task Properties) enhances US2 functionality
- US4 (Search & Filter) builds upon US2 and US3
- US5 (Recurring Tasks) depends on US2 and US3 for task creation
- US6 (Data Isolation) applies to all other user stories

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **Authentication Components** (US1): JWT verification, current_user dependency, middleware can be developed in parallel
- **CRUD Functions** (US2): create_task, get_tasks, update_task, delete_task, toggle_completion can be developed in parallel
- **Filter Components** (US4): Status filter, priority filter, date filter can be developed in parallel
- **Utility Functions** (US3, US5): Timezone handling, recurrence logic, timestamp management can be developed in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP Scope**: Complete US1 (Authentication) and US2 (Task CRUD Operations) for basic functionality
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Add task properties (US3), search/filtering (US4), and recurrence (US5) in subsequent releases
3. **Quality Assurance**: Each user story should be independently testable before moving to the next
4. **Performance**: Optimize for dashboard with up to 1000+ tasks per user, with pagination planned for future scalability
