**Feature**: Full-Stack Todo App Integration
**Date**: 2026-01-12
**Status**: Complete

## Update Summary

The agent context has been updated with the following technology patterns and best practices for the full-stack todo app integration:

### New Technologies Added:
- uv (Astral's Python package manager) for backend dependency management
- FastAPI + SQLModel integration patterns
- Next.js + FastAPI communication patterns
- JWT token flow between frontend and backend
- Better Auth integration with FastAPI backend

### Best Practices Documented:
- Environment variable management with root .env file
- User data isolation via JWT token validation
- Error handling patterns for full-stack applications
- Testing strategies for integrated frontend/backend systems
- Deployment considerations for monorepo setups

### Integration Patterns:
- REST API communication between Next.js and FastAPI
- Proper authentication flow with shared secrets
- Rate limiting implementation
- Data validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for local development

This context update ensures that future agent interactions will be aware of these patterns and technologies when working on the full-stack todo app integration feature.
