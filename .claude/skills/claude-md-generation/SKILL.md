# CLAUDE.md Generation Skill

This is the final step — creating living documentation that helps both humans and AI collaborate effectively.

## Recommended Workflow Sequence
1. monorepo-setup → Establish structure
2. architecture-planning → Define layers and rules
3. spec-kit-configuration → Ensure design consistency
4. root-level-guidance → Configure shared tooling
5. claude-md-generation → Document everything (this file)

## Generated Content Includes
- Project overview
- Architecture diagrams
- Skill inventory
- Workflow guide
- Common commands

Final CLAUDE.md will be output in a clean markdown code block for easy copy-paste.

Congratulations — your monorepo is now fully structured and AI-ready!
